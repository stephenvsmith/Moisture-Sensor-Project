# Moisture Sensor Project

We (Zach and Stephen) are using a Raspberry Pi to perform various tasks that we are interested in as a learning experience.

So far, we have configued the Pi to receive input data from our moisture sensors to determine whether or not water is detected, and then to publish that information to our dashboard on Initial State.

Our next goal is to configure a camera to take photos of a plant on a regular basis so that we can create a timelapse video.
